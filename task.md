# Website for image presentation

## Background
We deal with a lot of images. We’d like our customers to see some of the images on the webapp,
and decide which ones are interesting to them.
The indication of an interest can be some sort of a flag, which is retained in a DB,
so that a member of Segmed can see it.
Think of going through the medical R&D “Store” and putting things in the dataset.
Please reach out to us if you have any questions regarding this project ASAP.

## Project
The task is to build a simple web-app. The webapp should display images as its main feature.  
Think of a simple gallery or a list view. Within the same list view, we’d like to have a “flag” or “tag” button.
This button will cause this image to be “remembered” in a DB.  
In other words: if I reload the page again, I’d like this image to remain flagged/tagged.

## Assumptions
- Pick any JPG images you want. Unsplash is a good example of image connection.
It’s up to you how/where you store images.
- Make it realistic/usable. Use any technology you feel comfortable with.
